Explain overfitting in machine learning. This paper examines the extent to which training samples overfitting leads to catastrophic forgetting of predictive data. We investigate the impact of data augmentation on this phenomenon and propose two techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by augmenting training samples. First, we propose a novel pre-trained dataset augmentation method named Pre-AI, which consists of a pre-trained dataset and a pre-trained dataset augmentation method. The pre-trained dataset augmentation method is designed to ensure the model is able to accurately predict the predictive data and to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Second, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that employs pre-trained datasets and pre-trained datasets augmentation. The pre-trained datasets and pre-trained datasets
