Prompt: What is machine learning? 

Generated text: In this paper, we present a novel approach to learn the relationship between models and data. We propose an algorithm that learns relationships using deep neural networks (DNNs) with high accuracy on real-world datasets such as Amazon Mechanical Turk or Google Docbook from pretraining for tasks like image classification in
